Come reset it.\"    \"You know where the button is.\" I protested through the shower    (pitter-patter). \"Reset it yourself!\" \"I am scared!\" She pleaded.    \"What if it starts going and sucks me in?\" Pause. \"C\\'mon, it\\'ll only    take a second.\" No logical assurance about how a disposal can\\'t start    itself will calm the fears of a person who suffers from    \"Big-ol-scary-machinephobia,\" a condition brought on by watching too    many Stephen King movies. It is futile to argue or explain, kind of    like Lloyd Bentsen telling Americans they are over-taxed. And if a    poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground    into round, I\\'d have to live with that the rest of my life. So out I    came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about    how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who    would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find    the button. It is the last action I remember performing. It struck    without warning. Nay, it wasn\\'t a hexed disposal drawing me into its    gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the    dangling objects she spied between my legs. She (\"Buttons\" aka \"the    Grater\") had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took    the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I was most    vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged    them with her needle-like claws. Now when men feel pain or even sense    danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all    rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively,    their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising    upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well-trained monk    could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a    kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild    animals are sometimes faced with a \"fight or flight\" syndrome; men, in    this predicament, choose only the \"flight\" option. Fleeing straight    up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed. It was a    dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never    made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the    impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics    stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics    snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their    hysterical laughter. My wife told me I should be flattered. At the    office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept    silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. \"What\\'s the matter, cat    got your tongue?\" If they had only known.', 'The expanded size of the tensor (622) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.

Tensor sizes: [1, 512] : There was an old married couple that had happily lived    together for nearly forty years. The only friction in their marriage    was caused by the husband\\'s habit of breaking wind nearly every    morning as he awoke. The noise would always wake up his wife and the    smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for    air. Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one    in the morning. He told her that the couldn\\'t help it. She begged him    to see a doctor to see if anything could be done but the husband    wouldn\\'t hear of it. He told her that it was just a natural bodily    function and then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the    fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was nothing natural    about it and if he didn\\'t stop, he was one day going to \"fart his guts    out\".    The years went by and the wife continued to suffer and the husband    continued to ignore her warnings about \"farting his guts out\" until    one Christmas morning. Before dawn, the wife went downstairs to    prepare the family feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed    potatoes, gravy and, of course, a turkey. While she was taking out the    turkey\\'s innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might    solve her husband\\'s problem. With a devilish grin on her face, she    placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours    before her flatulent husband would awake. While he was still soundly    asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her    husband\\'s jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey guts into    her husband\\'s underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and    tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing the family meal. Several    hours later she heard her husband awake with his normal loud ass    trumpeting. This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the    sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs    bathroom. The wife could not control herself and her eyes began to    tear up as she rolled on the floor laughing. After years of putting up    with him she had finally gotten even. About twenty minutes later, her    husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of    horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from laughing and she    asked him what was the matter. He said, \"honey, you were right - all    those years you warned me and I didn\\'t listen to you\".    \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.    \"Well you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one    of these days and today it finally happened.

Tensor sizes: [1, 512] : One evening after attending a concert, two men were walking down the    road when they    saw a well-dressed and attractive looking woman walking ahead of them.    One of the men    turned to the other and said, \"I\\'d give 50 bucks to spend the night    with her.\" To their    surprise the woman overheard the remark. Turning round she said, \"I\\'ll    take you up on    that.\" She had good appearance and a nice body, so after bidding his    companion \\'good    night\\', he followed her back to her apartment and they went straight    to bed. The following    morning the man presented her with 25.00. She demanded the rest of her    money.\"If you    don\\'t give me the remaining $25 I\\'ll sue you for it.\" He laughed,    saying, \"I\\'d like to see    you get it on those grounds!\" The next day,he was surprised to receive    a summons    ordering his appearance in Court as Defendant in a lawsuit. He rushed    to his atorney and    explained the circumstances to him. His atorney said, \"She can\\'t    possibly get a judgment    against you on such grounds, but it would interesting to see how her    case will be    presented.\" After the usual preliminaries, her lawyer addressed the    court as follows:-    Your honor, my client this lady here is the owner of a fine piece of    property, a garden spot    surrounded by a profuse of luscious shrubbery, which she agreed to    rent to the Defendant    for a specified length of time, for an agreed upon sum of $50. The    Defendant took    possession of the property, used it extensively for the purpose for    which it was rented, but    upon evacuation of the premises he paid only $25; half the agreed    amount. The rent was by    no means excessive, even though it was restricted property, and we ask    Judgment be    granted against Defendant to ensure payment of the balance.The    Defendant\\'s lawyer was    impressed and amused at the way his opponent had presented the case.    His defense was,    therefore, somewhat altered from the way he had originally planned to    present it.    Your Honor, my client agrees the young lady has a fine piece of    property,that he did rent    such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from    the transaction.    However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed    his stones,    erected a pump, and sunk a shaft, all labor being performed by him    personally. We claim    these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the    unpaid amount and that the    plaintiff was more than adequately satisfied and compensated for the    rental of the said    property. We therefore ask Judgment not be granted.    The young lady\\'s lawyer\\'s comeback was this:- Your Honor, my client    agrees that the    Defendant did find a well on her property and that he did make    improvements such as my    opponent has described. However had the Defendant not known the well    existed, he would    not have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the    Defendant removed    his stones, pulled out his shaft and took the pump with him. In so    doing, he not only    dragged his equipment through the shrubbery, leaving my client to do    the cleaning up, but    he left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, thus    making it very easily    accessible to little children. We therefore ask that Judgment be    granted.    SHE GOT IT!', \"The expanded size of the tensor (584) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 584].

The accounts person asks her    how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little    old lady says, \"Three million dollars.\" The accounts person is    startled, and says, \"In what form?\" and the little old lady says,    \"Cash.

This is a highly unusual event,    and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the    bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady    to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the    little old lady where she got so much money. She says, \"Gambling.\"    \"Gambling?\", he says. \"What sort of gambling?\" \"Oh, I make bets with    people on all sorts of things, and I usually win.

Is it a bet?\" \"Ok, have it    your way\", said the president, and they shook hands on it. \"See you at    11:55 tomorrow morning\", said the little old lady, and with that she    left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger    man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president\\'s    office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one.

He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still    nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started    to relax, knowing he had won. \"Come in, please have a seat! Who might    this gentleman be?\" said the president. \"He\\'s my lawyer. For a bet of    this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?\" \"No, perfectly    understandable\", said the president. \"Well, it\\'s now noon, and I\\'m    still unchanged, so I guess I win!\" he said happily. \"Not so fast!\"    said the little old lady. \"For a hundred grand I want to verify things    personally! Please drop your pants.\" The bank president is a bit    flustered, but agrees that in her position he\\'d want proof as well, so    he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches    out to feel the organs in question. \"Ok, you win, here\\'s your    $100,000,\" says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As    she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and    moaning. \"What\\'s wrong with him?\" asks the bank president. \"Oh, he\\'s    just upset. Poor loser if you ask me.

Next thing he sees is an  advertisement for a guaranteed weight loss program.  Guaranteed like  heck, he thinks to himself. But lets see what they think they can do.  He calls them on the phone and subscribes to the 3 day, 10 LB weight  loss program.  The next day there comes a knock at his door, and when he answers,  there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic 19 year old babe  dressed in nothing but a pair of Nikes and a sign hanging around her  neck.  She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss  company.  The sign reads, If you can catch me, you can have me. Well,  without a second thought he takes off after her (like who wouldn't).  A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has  his way with her.  After they are through he kisses the girl one last  time and thinks to himself with a nod, I like the way this company  does business.  For the next two days, the same girl shows up and the same thing  happens each time.  On the fourth day, he weighs himself and, sure  enough, he has lost 10 pounds.  Deciding that he likes his somewhat  more slender physique, not to mention the method of treatment, he  calls the company back  and subscribes to their 5 day, 20 LB weight  loss program. He thinks that losing 20 pounds in only 5 days seems  like a lot, but he is intrigued by what their workout schedule might  be like this time.  As expected, the next day there comes a knock at his door. When he  answers it there stands a 22 year old knockout dressed in nothing but  a pair of Reeboks and a sign hanging around her neck. She is simply  stunning, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.  She introduces  herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign  reads, If you can catch me, you can have me. He's out the door like a  shot. This gal is in excellent shape and it takes a while to catch  her.  But when he does, it is worth every cramp and wheeze.  She is  wonderful, the best he has ever had. He is really looking forward to  the next four days... For the next four days, the same girl shows up  and the same thing happens each time, much to his delight.  On the  sixth day, he weighs himself and, unbelievably, he has lost another 20  pounds.  I love this company, he thinks to himself, I never knew  losing weight could be so easy and so much fun.  Feeling much better about himself, he decides to go for broke and  subscribe to the companies 7 day, 50 pound weight loss program. Are  you sure, sir? asks the representative on the phone. This is our most  rigorous program. Absolutely, says he, I love your program. haven't  felt  this good in years!  The next day there comes a knock at his  door and he enthusiastically answers it. There stands before him a 200  pound perfect specimen of a man dressed in nothing but racing spikes  and a sign around his neck.

The new law was that, in order to get into    Heaven, you had to have a really bad day the day you died. The policy    would go into effect at noon the following day. So the next day at    12:01 the first person came to the gates of Heaven.    The angel at the gate, remembering about the new law, promptly told    the man, \"Before I can let you in, I need you to tell me about the day    you died.\"    \"No problem.\" said the man. \"Well, for some time now, I\\'ve thought my    wife was having an affair.

But wouldn\\'t you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall    and he didn\\'t die. This pissed me off even more, so in a rage I went    back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at    him. And oddly enough, the first thing I could grab was the    refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and    heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him!    The excitement of the moment was so great that right after that I had    a heart attack and died almost instantly.\"    The angel sat back and though for a moment. Technically, the guy DID    have a bad day, and it was a crime of passion, so he announced, \"OK,    Sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,\" and let him in.

As I\\'m    laying there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating    pain, I see the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the    ledge and it falls directly on top of me and kills me!\"    The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his    story. \"I could get used to this new policy,\" he thinks to himself.    \"Very well,\" the angel announces. \"Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,\"    and he lets the man enter.    A few seconds later the third man in line comes up to the gate. \"Tell    me about the day you died,\" said the angel.    \"OK, picture this, \" says the man. \"I\\'m naked inside a    Refrigerator.......\"', 'The expanded size of the tensor (776) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.

The controller working a busy    pattern told the 727 on downwind to make a 360 (do a complete circle,    usually done to provide spacing between aircraft). The pilot of the    727 complained, \"Do you know it costs us two thousand dollars to make    a 360 in this airplane?\"    Without missing a beat the controller replied, \"Roger, give me four    thousand dollars worth.\"    ------------------------------------------------    November 15, 1996 - What the...?! PSA was following United, taxiing    out for departure. PSA called the tower and said \"Tower, this is    United 586. We\\'ve got a little problem, so go ahead and let PSA go    first.\"    The tower promptly cleared PSA fortakeoff before United had a chance    to object to the impersonation.    ------------------------------------------------    November 8, 1996 - Which Exit Did You Say That Was? A DC-10 had an    exceedingly long landing rollout after landing with his approach speed    just a little too high...San Jose Tower: \"American 751 Heavy, turn    right at the end if able. If not able, take the Guadalupe exit off of    Highway 101 back to the airport.\"    ------------------------------------------------    November 1, 1996 - Ouch! Western Airlines had a term for its second    officers. The term was \"GIB,\" and stood for \"Guy In Back.\" The term    was strictly unofficial and was actually frowned upon by the    management at Western. It seems that some wise-guy pilot had been    browsing through a dictionary and had made the discovery that a \"gib\"    is a castrated tomcat.    ------------------------------------------------    October 11, 1996 - What Is That Thang? It was a really nice day, right    about dusk, and a Piper Malibu was being vectored into a long line of    airliners in order to land at Kansas City...    KC Approach: \"Malibu three-two-Charlie, you\\'re following a 727, one    o\\'clock and three miles.    \"Three-two-Charlie: \"We\\'ve got him. We\\'ll follow him.\"    KC Approach: \"Delta 105, your traffic to follow is a Malibu, eleven    o\\'clock and three miles. Do you have that traffic?    \"Delta 105: (long pause and then in a thick southern drawl) \"Well...    I\\'ve got something down there. Can\\'t quite tell if it\\'s a Malibu or a    Chevelle, though.\"    ------------------------------------------------    September 6, 1996 - Mmmm-mmm, Good! Tower: \"Eastern 702, cleared for    takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7.\"    Eastern 702: \"Tower, Eastern 702 switching to Departure... by the way,    as we lifted off, we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of    the runway.\"    Tower: \"Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on    124.7... did you copy the report from Eastern?\"    Continental 635: \"Continental 635, cleared for takeoff... and yes, we    copied Eastern and we\\'ve already notified our caterers.\"    ------------------------------------------------    June 28, 1996 - No, That\\'s not what I Said! O\\'Hare Approach Control:    \"United 329, traffic is a Fokker, one o\\'clock, 3 miles, eastbound.\"    United 329: \"Approach, I\\'ve always wanted to say this... I\\'ve got that    Fokker in sight.\"    What did Bill Gates\\' wife say to him on their wedding night? \"Now I    know why you named your company Microsoft!', 'The expanded size of the tensor (734) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.

      "B-org Dane Three dogs are sitting in the waiting room of a vets office. One is a poodle, one is a schnauzer and the other is a great Dane. The poodle turns to the schnauzer and asks \"why are you here?\" The schnauzer responds, \"I'm 17 years old. I don't see or hear very well. I've been having accidents in the house. My owner says I'm too old and sick so he brought me here to be put to sleep.\" The schnauzer asks the poodle \"why are you here?\" The poodle responds, \"I've not been myself lately. I've been especially high strung. I've been barking all the time, I've been snapping at people and I even bit one of the neighbor's kids. Nobody knows why this has been happening. My owner says he can't risk me biting somebody else so he brought me here to be put to sleep.\" The poodle and schnauzer ask the great Dane why he is here. The great Dane responds: \"My owner is this beautiful runway model. Yesterday she was walking around the house naked when she suddenly bent down to pick up something she dropped. She was bent over and naked when nature took over and the next thing I know I'm on top of her doing the doggie thing. I couldn't help myself. \" The poodle asks: \"so she brought you here to put to sleep?\" \"Oh, no...., I'm just here to get my nails trimmed.\"\n",

      "B-org Mercedes A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse    falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go    and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to    the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's    Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He    then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and    drives the car forward saving him from sinking!    A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow    again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to    the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, \"I    think I can stand over the hole!\" So he stretched over the width of    the hole and said, \"Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up.\" And    the chicken did and pulled himself to safety.    The moral of the story:    If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up    chicks.\n",

      "B-org THEM Voice Mail. Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People don't call you just because they want to give you something for nothing - they call because they want YOU to do work for THEM. That's no way to live. Screen all your calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour when you know they're not there - it looks like you're hardworking and conscientious even though you're being a devious weasel. If you diligently employ the method of screening incoming calls and then returning calls when nobody is there, this will greatly increase the odds that the caller will give up or look for a solution that doesn't involve you. The sweetest voice mail message you can ever hear is: \"Ignore my last message. I took care of it\". If your voice mailbox has a limit on the number of messages it can hold, make sure you reach that limit frequently. One way to do that is to never erase any incoming messages. If that takes too long, send yourself a few messages. Your callers will hear a recorded message that says, \"Sorry, this mailbox is full\" - a sure sign that you are a hardworking employee in high demand.\n",

      "B-org IBMMemo IBM Memo about Peripheral Replacement    This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to all    IBM Branch Offices. The person who wrote it was very serious. The rest    of us may find it rather funny.    Abstract: Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit) Mouse    balls are now available as FRU. Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate    or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement.    Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse    balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.    Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the    underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than    foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon    manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the    pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced using the twist-off    method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However,    excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. Upon completion of    ball replacement, the mouse maybe used immediately.    It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for    maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer    missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these    necessary items.\n",

Occasionally    your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just    accept this, restart and drive on. Occasionally, executing a maneuver    would cause your car to stop and fail, and you would have to    re-install the engine. for some strange reason, you would accept this    too. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you    bought \"Car95\" or \"CarNT\". But then you would have to buy more seats.    Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,    five times faster, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on 5% of    the roads. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft    upgrades for their cars, which would make their cars run much slower.    The oil, gas and alternator lights would be replaced with single    \"general car fault\" lights. The airbag system would say \"Are you    sure?\" before going off. If you were involved in a crash, you would    have no idea what happened.\n",

His legs are bare and he's wearing worn-out shoes.  His entire face and body are riddled with pierced jewellery and his earring are big, bright feathers.

      "B-org IRS The local bar was so sure that its bartender was the    strongest man around that they offered a standing $1,000.00 bet. The    bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass,    and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop    of juice out would win the money. Many people had tried over time    (weightlifters, longshoremen, etc.) but nobody could do it.    One day this scrawny little man came in, wearing thick glasses and a    polyester suit, and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, \"I'd like to try    the bet.\" After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK,    grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled    remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned    to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six    drops fell into the glass.    As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1,000.00, and asked the    little man, \"what do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a    weightlifter, or what?\" The man replied, \"I work for the IRS.\"\n",

It works just like  every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you  probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a  sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the  ceiling.  Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If  you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before  assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children,  decide now which one you love more.\"\n",

      "B-org UnitedAirlines For all of you out there who've had to deal with an irate customer, this one is for you. It's a classic! In tribute to those 'special' customers we all love!  An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent in Denver for being smart and funny, and making her point, when confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo. A crowded United flight was canceled.  A single agent was rebooking a long line of inconvenienced travelers.  Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, \"I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS.\"  The agent replied, \"I'm sorry sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.\"  The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear, \"Do you have any idea who I am?\"  Without hesitating, the gate agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone. \"May I have your attention please?\" she began, her voice bellowing throughout the terminal. \"We have a passenger here at the gate WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to the gate.\"  With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore, \"F*** you.\"  Without flinching, she smiled and said, \"I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to stand in line for that, too.\"\n",
