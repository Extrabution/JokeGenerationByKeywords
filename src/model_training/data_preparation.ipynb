How\\'s the tractor selling business these days?\" If Chris had    looked sad before, at    the mention of tractor sales, his face sank even more, and a tear came    to his eye.    \"John,\" he said, shaking his head, \"I don\\'t know what it is. I can\\'t    sell a tractor these days    to save my life. I\\'ll tell you, I just gotta sell one tractor and    soon, or else I\\'ll lose that    dealership for good.\"    \"Well,\" John said, taking the barstool next to him, \"If you think you    got it bad, I got it    worse.

Anyway, no    sooner did I sit    down on the milking stool and get to work, but ol\\' Bes starts a    slappin\\' me with her tail.    After a minute or so, I got fed up with it, so I threw a rope up over    the rafters, and tied ol\\'    Bessy\\'s tail to the rafters. Then I got back to work.\" \"I didn\\'t even    get two squirts into the    bucket, when Bes gives me a kick. Knocked me clean off the stool! Boy,    did that upset    me! So I get me another rope an\\' tie Bessy\\'s right hind leg to the    side of the milking stall,    and get a started trying to milk her again.\" \"Well by this time,    Bessy\\'s about livid, and she    doesn\\'t want any part of it, so she let\\'s me have it with her other    hind leg. I wasn\\'t about    to give in to this ol\\' cow, so I got me yet another piece of rope and    tied up Bessy\\'s left leg    to the other side of the stall.\" Just then John paused to take a sip    his beer.    Chris, distracted for a moment from his own troubles, asked John,    \"Well, did you finally    get to milk her?\" \"Well, yes and no, Chris. But I\\'ll tell ya what...

Again proceed as in 1, except when you have cat firmly cradled in     bottle-feeding position, sit down on edge of chair, fold your torso     over cat, bring your right hand over your left elbow, open cat\\'s     mouth by lifting the upper jaw and pop the pill in -- quickly.

Target sizes: [1, 825].  Tensor sizes: [1, 512] : A Cat Owner\\'s Story Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable    because no matter how legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss    thinks I am lying. On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied    anyway because the truth was too humiliating to reveal. I simply    mentioned that I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel    up to coming in the next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to    explain the bandage on my crown. In this case, the truth hurt. I mean    it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain. The accident    occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife\\'s wishes to adopt a cute    little kitty. As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower    after breakfast when I heard my wife call out to me from the kitchen.    \"Ed!\" she hearkened. \"The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it.\"    \"You know where the button is.\" I protested through the shower    (pitter-patter). \"Reset it yourself!\" \"I am scared!\" She pleaded.    \"What if it starts going and sucks me in?\" Pause. \"C\\'mon, it\\'ll only    take a second.\" No logical assurance about how a disposal can\\'t start    itself will calm the fears of a person who suffers from    \"Big-ol-scary-machinephobia,\" a condition brought on by watching too    many Stephen King movies. It is futile to argue or explain, kind of    like Lloyd Bentsen telling Americans they are over-taxed. And if a    poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground    into round, I\\'d have to live with that the rest of my life. So out I    came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about    how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who    would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find    the button. It is the last action I remember performing. It struck    without warning. Nay, it wasn\\'t a hexed disposal drawing me into its    gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the    dangling objects she spied between my legs. She (\"Buttons\" aka \"the    Grater\") had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took    the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I was most    vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged    them with her needle-like claws. Now when men feel pain or even sense    danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all    rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively,    their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising    upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well-trained monk    could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a    kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild    animals are sometimes faced with a \"fight or flight\" syndrome; men, in    this predicament, choose only the \"flight\" option. Fleeing straight    up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed. It was a    dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never    made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the    impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics    stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics    snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their    hysterical laughter. My wife told me I should be flattered. At the    office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept    silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. \"What\\'s the matter, cat    got your tongue?\" If they had only known.', 'The expanded size of the tensor (622) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.

Tensor sizes: [1, 512] : There was an old married couple that had happily lived    together for nearly forty years. The only friction in their marriage    was caused by the husband\\'s habit of breaking wind nearly every    morning as he awoke. The noise would always wake up his wife and the    smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for    air. Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one    in the morning. He told her that the couldn\\'t help it. She begged him    to see a doctor to see if anything could be done but the husband    wouldn\\'t hear of it. He told her that it was just a natural bodily    function and then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the    fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was nothing natural    about it and if he didn\\'t stop, he was one day going to \"fart his guts    out\".    The years went by and the wife continued to suffer and the husband    continued to ignore her warnings about \"farting his guts out\" until    one Christmas morning. Before dawn, the wife went downstairs to    prepare the family feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed    potatoes, gravy and, of course, a turkey. While she was taking out the    turkey\\'s innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might    solve her husband\\'s problem. With a devilish grin on her face, she    placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours    before her flatulent husband would awake. While he was still soundly    asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her    husband\\'s jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey guts into    her husband\\'s underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and    tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing the family meal. Several    hours later she heard her husband awake with his normal loud ass    trumpeting. This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the    sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs    bathroom. The wife could not control herself and her eyes began to    tear up as she rolled on the floor laughing. After years of putting up    with him she had finally gotten even. About twenty minutes later, her    husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of    horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from laughing and she    asked him what was the matter. He said, \"honey, you were right - all    those years you warned me and I didn\\'t listen to you\".    \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.    \"Well you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one    of these days and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God    and these two fingers, I think I got \\'em all back in.\"', 'The expanded size of the tensor (714) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.

Tensor sizes: [1, 512] : One evening after attending a concert, two men were walking down the    road when they    saw a well-dressed and attractive looking woman walking ahead of them.    One of the men    turned to the other and said, \"I\\'d give 50 bucks to spend the night    with her.\" To their    surprise the woman overheard the remark. Turning round she said, \"I\\'ll    take you up on    that.\" She had good appearance and a nice body, so after bidding his    companion \\'good    night\\', he followed her back to her apartment and they went straight    to bed. The following    morning the man presented her with 25.00. She demanded the rest of her    money.\"If you    don\\'t give me the remaining $25 I\\'ll sue you for it.\" He laughed,    saying, \"I\\'d like to see    you get it on those grounds!\" The next day,he was surprised to receive    a summons    ordering his appearance in Court as Defendant in a lawsuit. He rushed    to his atorney and    explained the circumstances to him. His atorney said, \"She can\\'t    possibly get a judgment    against you on such grounds, but it would interesting to see how her    case will be    presented.\" After the usual preliminaries, her lawyer addressed the    court as follows:-    Your honor, my client this lady here is the owner of a fine piece of    property, a garden spot    surrounded by a profuse of luscious shrubbery, which she agreed to    rent to the Defendant    for a specified length of time, for an agreed upon sum of $50. The    Defendant took    possession of the property, used it extensively for the purpose for    which it was rented, but    upon evacuation of the premises he paid only $25; half the agreed    amount. The rent was by    no means excessive, even though it was restricted property, and we ask    Judgment be    granted against Defendant to ensure payment of the balance.The    Defendant\\'s lawyer was    impressed and amused at the way his opponent had presented the case.    His defense was,    therefore, somewhat altered from the way he had originally planned to    present it.    Your Honor, my client agrees the young lady has a fine piece of    property,that he did rent    such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from    the transaction.    However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed    his stones,    erected a pump, and sunk a shaft, all labor being performed by him    personally. We claim    these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the    unpaid amount and that the    plaintiff was more than adequately satisfied and compensated for the    rental of the said    property. We therefore ask Judgment not be granted.    The young lady\\'s lawyer\\'s comeback was this:- Your Honor, my client    agrees that the    Defendant did find a well on her property and that he did make    improvements such as my    opponent has described. However had the Defendant not known the well    existed, he would    not have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the    Defendant removed    his stones, pulled out his shaft and took the pump with him. In so    doing, he not only    dragged his equipment through the shrubbery, leaving my client to do    the cleaning up, but    he left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, thus    making it very easily    accessible to little children. We therefore ask that Judgment be    granted.    SHE GOT IT!', \"The expanded size of the tensor (584) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 584].

This is a highly unusual event,    and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the    bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady    to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the    little old lady where she got so much money. She says, \"Gambling.\"    \"Gambling?\", he says. \"What sort of gambling?\" \"Oh, I make bets with    people on all sorts of things, and I usually win.

Any objections?\" \"No, perfectly    understandable\", said the president. \"Well, it\\'s now noon, and I\\'m    still unchanged, so I guess I win!\" he said happily. \"Not so fast!\"    said the little old lady. \"For a hundred grand I want to verify things    personally! Please drop your pants.\" The bank president is a bit    flustered, but agrees that in her position he\\'d want proof as well, so    he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches    out to feel the organs in question. \"Ok, you win, here\\'s your    $100,000,\" says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As    she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and    moaning. \"What\\'s wrong with him?\" asks the bank president. \"Oh, he\\'s    just upset. Poor loser if you ask me.

It can no longer in good conscience associate itself with    the show.\" Willis said D\\'s withdrawal is effective immediately, and    applies to both capital and lower-case versions of the letter.    The gay muppet, \"Bruce,\" will be introduced on Sesame Street Dec. 23,    CTW director Leslie Charren said. Thus far, no other sponsors have    pulled out, though the number seven has requested an advance tape of    the episode before it makes a decision.    Many public-television insiders believe D\\'s withdrawal was motivated    by a desire not to alienate religious conservatives, a section of the    population that employs the letter frequently.    \"D is for, among other things, demagoguery, dogma and doctrine, words    crucial to right-wing groups like the Christian Coalition,\" said Yale    University political-science professor J. Wright Franklin. \"It is    likely that D felt it could ill afford to offend such a large segment    of its users.\"    While a long-term replacement for D has not yet been secured by Sesame    Street, the number three will temporarily fill in for it in a number    of the show\\'s animated shorts. Other pieces will simply skip from C to    E, with vocalists stretching out C into two syllables to match the    rhythm of the alphabet song.    Sesame Street is stung by the sudden departure of its longtime    supporter. Speaking to reporters, cast member Cookie Monster said: \"Me    disappointed letter D choose to end relationship with Sesame Street    due to pressure from extremely vocal minority.

He calls them on the phone and subscribes to the 3 day, 10 LB weight  loss program.  The next day there comes a knock at his door, and when he answers,  there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic 19 year old babe  dressed in nothing but a pair of Nikes and a sign hanging around her  neck.  She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss  company.  The sign reads, If you can catch me, you can have me. Well,  without a second thought he takes off after her (like who wouldn't).  A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has  his way with her.  After they are through he kisses the girl one last  time and thinks to himself with a nod, I like the way this company  does business.  For the next two days, the same girl shows up and the same thing  happens each time.  On the fourth day, he weighs himself and, sure  enough, he has lost 10 pounds.  Deciding that he likes his somewhat  more slender physique, not to mention the method of treatment, he  calls the company back  and subscribes to their 5 day, 20 LB weight  loss program. He thinks that losing 20 pounds in only 5 days seems  like a lot, but he is intrigued by what their workout schedule might  be like this time.  As expected, the next day there comes a knock at his door. When he  answers it there stands a 22 year old knockout dressed in nothing but  a pair of Reeboks and a sign hanging around her neck. She is simply  stunning, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.  She introduces  herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign  reads, If you can catch me, you can have me.

He is really looking forward to  the next four days... For the next four days, the same girl shows up  and the same thing happens each time, much to his delight.  On the  sixth day, he weighs himself and, unbelievably, he has lost another 20  pounds.  I love this company, he thinks to himself, I never knew  losing weight could be so easy and so much fun.  Feeling much better about himself, he decides to go for broke and  subscribe to the companies 7 day, 50 pound weight loss program. Are  you sure, sir? asks the representative on the phone.

And oddly enough, the first thing I could grab was the    refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and    heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him!    The excitement of the moment was so great that right after that I had    a heart attack and died almost instantly.\"    The angel sat back and though for a moment.

Luckily however, I was able to catch myself by my fingertips    on the balcony directly beneath mine. When all of a sudden this crazy    man comes running out of his apartment and starts cussing and stomping    on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on    the way down which broke my fall so I didn\\'t die right away.

KC Approach: \"Malibu three-two-Charlie, you\\'re following a 727, one    o\\'clock and three miles.    \"Three-two-Charlie: \"We\\'ve got him. We\\'ll follow him.\"    KC Approach: \"Delta 105, your traffic to follow is a Malibu, eleven    o\\'clock and three miles. Do you have that traffic?    \"Delta 105: (long pause and then in a thick southern drawl) \"Well...    I\\'ve got something down there. Can\\'t quite tell if it\\'s a Malibu or a    Chevelle, though.\"    ------------------------------------------------    September 6, 1996 - Mmmm-mmm, Good! Tower: \"Eastern 702, cleared for    takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7.\"    Eastern 702: \"Tower, Eastern 702 switching to Departure... by the way,    as we lifted off, we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of    the runway.\"    Tower: \"Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on    124.7... did you copy the report from Eastern?\"    Continental 635: \"Continental 635, cleared for takeoff... and yes, we    copied Eastern and we\\'ve already notified our caterers.\"    ------------------------------------------------    June 28, 1996 - No, That\\'s not what I Said! O\\'Hare Approach Control:    \"United 329, traffic is a Fokker, one o\\'clock, 3 miles, eastbound.\"    United 329: \"Approach, I\\'ve always wanted to say this... I\\'ve got that    Fokker in sight.\"    What did Bill Gates\\' wife say to him on their wedding night? \"Now I    know why you named your company Microsoft!', 'The expanded size of the tensor (734) must match the existing size (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.
